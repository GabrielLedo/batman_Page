                <h2>About The Batman creation</h2>
                <p>
                    Batman is a superhero published by DC Comics. 
                    Operating in Gotham City, he serves as its protector, using the symbol of a bat to strike fear into the hearts of criminals. 
                    Unlike other superheroes, Batman is often depicted to lack any "superpowers", instead using lifelong training and equipment to fight crime. 
                    His secret identity is Bruce Wayne, a rich playboy and philanthropist who swore to fight crime after witnessing his parents' brutal murder. 
                    He has served as a member of various teams, including the Justice League, the Justice Society of America and the Outsiders. 
                    Batman is also the founder and leader of various teams, including the Batman Family, Batmen of All Nations and Batman Incorporated. 
                    He also goes by numerous nicknames, including "The Dark Knight", "the Caped Crusader", "World's Greatest Detective" and the "Defender of Gotham".
